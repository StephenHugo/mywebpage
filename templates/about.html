	<p>This page is hosted on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, running <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> with <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>.
		The Heroku support and documentation are outstanding, as is the Flask documentation, but I wouldn't have gotten off the ground at all were it not for <a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/">Miguel Grinberg</a> and his wonderful <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/miguelgrinberg/flask-by-example-pycon-2014">talk</a>.
		This webpage application is build from his template, cloned from github.</p>
	<p>My <a href="https://github.com/StephenHugo">Github</a> contains the code for this page, as well as for the Javascipt/Jquery-powered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway: Game of Life</a> script running in my projects section. 
		I coded it following direction from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwwg81Zsj3c">Guido Tapia</a>, and added my own tweaks to allow click-ability!
		Please enjoy that little game for what it's worth, and check back later for improvements and revisions!</p>
