		Please, check out <b><a href="https://github.com/StephenHugo">my Github</a></b> to get the code for this page and other projects I can share. 
		I am fluent in <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">MATLAB</a> and now python, with moderate experience with C++, java, javascript, and good knowledge of <a href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">ImageJ</a>.
		On the other hand, I'm experienced with cell culture, protein purification, molecular biology, rheology and microscopy. 
		Before joining the Chemical Engineering department at UF, I had volunteer experience at Arnold Palmer children's Hospital in Orlando, Fl, as well as an internship at the Jacksonville Cardiovascular Center in Jacksonville, FL. 
		Before that, I had received a first responder's licence from Santa Fe College in Gainesville, Fl. 
		I have a passion for people and health, and the capability to improve their lives through education and hard work.

		This page is hosted on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, running <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> with <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>.
		The Heroku support and documentation are outstanding, as is the Flask documentation, but I wouldn't have gotten off the ground at all were it not for <a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/">Miguel Grinberg</a> and his wonderful <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/miguelgrinberg/flask-by-example-pycon-2014">talk</a>.
		This webpage application was built from his initial direction.
