		Through a collaboration with the<a href='http://ssamg.stat.fsu.edu/'>SSAMG</a> at FSU, I combined accurate cell boundary segmentation with the power of geodesic shape analysis.
		The 2-D curves generated after segmentation of cell tracking images were projected onto a manifold that represents the shape space of closed curves, granting the ability to measure the distance between two cell shapes via minimal geodesic paths.
		Using those distances, I applied<a href='http://www.timotheecour.com/'>Timothe Cour's</a> graph cut algorithm to cluster the shapes cells took over time, identifying common morphologies that may correspond with migration events.

		I am currently exploring the statistical properties of the shape space, centered around the mean shape of common migration morphologies.
		My goal is to simulate and predict cell migration events using this approach.
